# _Which Programming Language Should You Learn?_ 
_A programming language suggester_

#### _A short questionaire that suggests a user learn one of three programming languages, June 5, 2020_

#### By _**Ian Scott**_

## Description

_This website asks the user five questions, and based on the response, reccomends learning one of three programming languages. Only the first two questions determine the language, the other three are just for laughs, and each have a secret result for a specific response._

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* _Clone this repository located at: https://github.com/Scott-Ian/Programming-Language-Suggester.git_
* _Open index.html located in the main branch of the repository using your preferred web browser_
* _An internet connection is reccomended to experience all secret results, but not required_
* _Alternatively you can visit scott-ian.github.io/Programming-language-Suggester_


## Known Bugs

_There are no known bugs. However, the scripts.js could be slightly simplified. By adjusting the hideSecrets function (lines 47 and 72) to also hide all possible results, I would not have needed to include the hideOtherResults (line 18) function, nor reference it in the languageEval(lines 2-15) function. However, I wanted to practice factoring functions when possible._
